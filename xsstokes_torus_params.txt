Model description
-----------------

!! CAUTION, THE MODEL IS STILL IN A TESTING MODE, DO NOT USE FOR HIGHER 
INCLINATIONS AND LOWER HALF-OPENING ANGLES, THAN SUGGESTED BY THE 
lmodel-stokesni.dat FILE !!

This model computes the emission and its polarisation properties from
an X-ray source of power-law emission of arbitrary incident polarisation 
that is reprocessed in axially symmetric structures. The reprocessing
is precomputed in a form of FITS fits files that are required for
usage. These files were computed for three different states
of incident polarisation and this model interpolates for any primary
polarisation state. In addition it possesses other properties of the
reprocessing tables that were precomputed for nearly neutral disc reflection.

In this case of xsstokes_torus, it is reflection from a toroidal structure,
representing an opaque AGN torus illuminated by a central hot X-ray corona.
More details on the reflection model that was computed using the routine
torus_integrator.py are given in Podgorný J. et al. (in prep.). Apart from
the incident polarisation degree and angle, the model then also depends on
observer's inclination angle, the half-opening angle of the torus,
the primary power-law index Gamma, the position angle on the sky, and
the overall Dopler shift. No relativistic effects inside the system 
are taken into account. All components are static. The central source
is an isotropic point-like emission. The output has arbitrary flux
normalization.

For any issues regarding the use of xsstokes_torus, please, contact J. Podgorný at

  - defines the output of the model:
    - -1: the output is defined according to the XFLT0001 keyword of the 
          SPECTRUM extension of the data file, where "Stokes:0" means photon 
          number density flux, "Stokes:1" means Stokes parameter Q devided by 
          energy and "Stokes:2" means Stokes parameter U devided by energy
    -  0: array of photon number density flux per bin (array of Stokes parameter 
          I devided by energy) with the polarisation computations switched off

Required files
--------------

* Source code files
  - xsstokes_torus.c
  - lmodel-stokesni.dat  
* tables for reprocessing of photons in distant opaque toroidal structure, more details in Podgorný J. et al. (in prep.)
  - 23576493.zip (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23576493)  


Installation and usage in XSPEC
-------------------------------

1. Download the source code files
   into a directory where you want to install the model, e.g. '/path/to/xsstokes_torus-master/'

2. Download the FITS files 
   23576493.zip (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23576493) 
   with the tables into the directory with xsstokes_torus, i.e. '/path/to/xsstokes_torus-master'.

3. Unzip the reflection tables with polarisation information, e.g. by the command:

   unzip 23576493.zip
   
4. Compile the code inside XSPEC (needed to be done only once):

   The code is compiled inside XSPEC with the following command (assuming all 
   the source files and FITS tables are in the directory 
   '/path/to/xsstokes_torus-master'):

   initpackage stokesni lmodel-stokesni.dat /path/to/xsstokes_torus-master

   Note:
   Your XSPEC installation must have been originally installed from the source 
   code distribution. Local models, like xsstokes_torus, cannot be used if the XSPEC 
   was originally installed from the pre-compiled binary distribution.

5. Load the xsstokes_torus model into XSPEC:

   To use the xsstokes_torus model inside XSPEC, first the model package needs to be 
   loaded and directory containing the xsstokes_torus set:

   lmod stokesni /path/to/xsstokes_torus-master

6. Then the xsstokes_torus model may be used in the usual way, e.g.:

   mo stokes

   Note:
   In case of segmentation fault, one may need to increase the stack size before 
   launching XSPEC, e.g. with the command:

   ulimit -s unlimited

   or 

   ulimit -s 65532
